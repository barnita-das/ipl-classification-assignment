# IPL Classification Assignment

**Author**: Barnita Das  
**Roll Number**: 06

This project involves building classification models to predict the outcome of IPL matches based on pre-match conditions.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the IPL Matches Dataset from Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nowke9/ipldata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nowke9/ipldata)

## Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Voting Classifier (Ensemble)

## Results

| Model                 | Validation Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Logistic Regression   | 0.58                | 0.55          |
| Random Forest         | 0.52                | 0.50          |
| KNN                   | 0.50                | 0.48          |
| Ensemble (Voting)     | N/A                 | 0.54          |
